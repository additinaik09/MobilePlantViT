**🌱 MobilePlantViT

A Lightweight Hybrid Vision Transformer for Plant Disease Detection (CCMT Dataset)**

📌 Project Overview

Plant diseases significantly reduce crop yield and threaten food security, especially in regions where expert diagnosis is not easily accessible. While deep learning models have shown strong performance in plant disease classification, most existing approaches are computationally heavy and unsuitable for deployment on mobile or edge devices.

MobilePlantViT is a lightweight hybrid CNN–Vision Transformer (ViT) model designed to enable real-time plant disease detection on mobile and edge devices.
The project focuses on efficient model design, practical deployment, and realistic evaluation using the CCMT dataset.

🎯 Objectives

Design a lightweight hybrid CNN–ViT architecture for plant disease classification

Achieve reliable accuracy with low computational and memory requirements

Enable mobile and edge deployment for real-world agricultural usage

Evaluate performance using only the CCMT dataset

📂 Dataset Used
